# ASodium_Go

This's a new go binding for libsodium based on my ASodium from C#. 

My skills are weaker than that of C# when using go.

If there're bugs, can let me know.

I am still going through the code and testing, when it's done, I will upload the code here.

If applicable, I will also put it onto packages on go website.
